# I developed a 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐤𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 using 𝐣𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐬𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠. The app features basic controls like 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭, 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐩, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐭 to track time, displaying it in 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐬 and 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐬. It utilizes 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 for user interactions and 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 for real-time updates without UI lag. The project demonstrates my ability to design responsive user interfaces and manage event-driven programming in Java.
